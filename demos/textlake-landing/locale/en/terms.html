<p style="text-align: justify"><br></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Welcome to Textlake.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">This Textlake Services Agreement (“Agreement”) is a legal agreement between Openlect, LLC. (“Textlake”, “us”, or “we”) and the entity or person (“you”, “your”, or “user”) who registered on the Textlake site to receive certain payment processing, data, technology and analytics services, and other business services that may be offered by Textlake and its affiliates (each, a “Service”). This Agreement describes the terms and conditions that apply to your use of the Services.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">If you do not understand any of the terms of this Agreement, please contact us before using the Services.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">You may not access or use any Services unless you agree to abide by all of the terms and conditions in this Agreement.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify">Section A: General Terms</h2><h3 style="text-align: justify">1. Overview of this Agreement</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify">This Agreement provides a general description of the Services that Textlake may provide to you, including those that allow you to accept payments from purchasers of your goods or services or donors to your organization (your “Customers”). We provide you with a more detailed description of the Services through published software libraries and application programming interfaces that may be used to access the Services (the “API”) and additional resources we make available to you on our website.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Before using the Services, you must register with Textlake and create an account (a “Textlake Account”).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>Section A</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>describes the process of registering for and using your Textlake Account.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>Section B</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>describes your use of the API and the Services.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>Section C</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>describes the Payment Processing Services, which are one type of Service provided by Textlake.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>Section D</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>describes proper handling, management, and use of data generated during your use of the Services, including your Customers’ data.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Finally,<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Section E</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>describes your liability to Textlake for all losses connected with your Textlake Account, your agreement to resolve all disputes with Textlake by arbitration and not in a lawsuit, and other legal terms that apply to you.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify">2. Your Textlake Account</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>a. Registration and Permitted Activities:</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>To register for a Textlake Account, you or the person or people submitting the application (your “Representative”) must provide us with your business or trade name, address, email, phone number, tax identification number, URL, the nature of your business or activities, and certain other information about you that we require. We may also collect personal information (including name, birthdate, and government-issued identification number) about your beneficial owners, principals, and your Textlake Account administrator. Until you have submitted, and we have reviewed and approved, all required information, your Textlake Account will be available to you on a preliminary basis only, and we may terminate it at any time and for any reason.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">If you use Payment Processing Services, your name (or the name used to identify you) and URL may appear on your Customers’ bank or other statements. To minimize confusion and avoid potential disputes, these descriptors must be recognizable to your Customers and must accurately describe your business or activities. You may only use Payment Processing Services to facilitate Transactions (as defined below) with your Customers. You may not use Payment Processing Services to send money to others, to conduct any personal transactions, or for any other purposes prohibited by this Agreement.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>b. Business Representative:</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>You and your Representative individually affirm to Textlake that your Representative is authorized to provide the information described in this Section A.2 on your behalf and to bind you to this Agreement. We may require you or your Representative to provide additional information or documentation demonstrating your Representative’s authority. Without the express written consent of Textlake, neither you nor your Representative may register or attempt to register for a Textlake Account on behalf of a user Textlake previously terminated from use of the Services.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">If you are a sole proprietor, you and your Representative also affirm that your Representative is personally responsible and liable for your use of the Services and your obligations to Customers, including payment of any amounts owed under this Agreement.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">The following special requirements apply in relation to persons that are not at least 18 years old. If you are an individual or sole proprietor, and you are not at least 18 years old, but you are 13 years old or older, your Representative must be your parent or legal guardian. If you are a legal entity that is owned, directly or indirectly, by an individual who is not at least 18 years old, but the individual is 13 years old or older, your Representative must either obtain the consent of your board or of an authorized officer. Any such approving board, authorized officer, parent, or legal guardian is responsible to Textlake and is legally bound to this Agreement as if it had agreed to the terms of this Agreement itself. **You may not use the Services if you are under 13 years of age. **</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>c. Validation and Underwriting:</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>At any time during the term of this Agreement and your use of the Services, we may require additional information from you to verify beneficial ownership or control of the business, validate information you provided, verify you or your Representative’s identity, and assess the risk associated with your business. This additional information may include business invoices, copies of government-issued identification, business licenses, or other information related to your business, its beneficial owners or principals. If you use Payment Processing Services, we may also request that you provide copies of financial statements or records pertaining to your compliance with this Agreement, or require you to provide a personal or company guarantee. Your failure to provide this information or material may result in suspension or termination of your Textlake Account.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">You authorize us to retrieve information about you from our service providers and other third parties and you authorize and direct such third parties to compile and provide such information to us. You acknowledge that this may include your name, addresses, and other data about you or your Representative. You acknowledge that we may use your information to verify any other information you provide to us, and that any information we collect may affect our assessment of your overall risk to our business. You acknowledge that in some cases, such information may lead to suspension or termination of your Textlake Account. Textlake may periodically update this information as part of our underwriting criteria and risk analysis procedures.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>d. Changes to Your Business, Keeping your Textlake Account Current:</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>You agree to keep the information in your Textlake Account current. You must promptly update your Textlake Account with any changes affecting you, the nature of your business activities, your Representatives, beneficial owners, principals, or any other pertinent information. We may suspend your Textlake Account or terminate this Agreement if you fail to keep this information current.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify">3. Your Relationship with Your Customers</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify">You may only use the Services for legitimate Transactions with your Customers. You know your Customers better than we do, and you are responsible for your relationship with them. Textlake is not responsible for the products or services you publicize or sell, or that your Customers purchase using the Services; or if you accept donations, for your communication to your Customers of the intended use of such donations. You affirm that you are solely responsible for the nature and quality of the products or services you provide, and for delivery, support, refunds, returns, and for any other ancillary services you provide to your Customers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Textlake provides Services to you but we have no way of knowing if any particular purchase, sale, donation, order, or other transaction (each a “Transaction”) is accurate or complete, or typical for your business. You are responsible for knowing whether a Transaction initiated by your Customer is erroneous (such as a Customer purchasing one item when they meant to order another) or suspicious (such as unusual or large purchases, or a request for delivery to a foreign country where this typically does not occur). If you are unsure if a Transaction is erroneous or suspicious, you agree to research the Transaction and, if necessary, contact your Customer before fulfilling or completing the Transaction. You are solely responsible for any losses you incur due to erroneous or fraudulent Transactions in connection with your use of the Services.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify">4. Fees and Fines</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify">Textlake will provide the Services to you at the rates and for the fees (“Fees”) described on the Pricing page. The Fees include charges for Transactions (such as processing a payment) and for other events connected with your Textlake Account (such as handling a disputed charge). We may revise the Fees at any time. However, we will provide you with at least 30 days’ advance notice before revisions become applicable to you (or a longer period of notice if this is required by applicable Law).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">In addition to the Fees, you are also responsible for any penalties or fines imposed in relation to your Textlake Account on you or Textlake by Textlake or any Payment Method Provider or Payment Method Acquirer (each as defined in Section C) resulting from your use of Payment Processing Services in a manner not permitted by this Agreement or a Payment Method Provider’s rules and regulations.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">You are also obligated to pay all taxes, fees and other charges imposed by any governmental authority (“Taxes”), including any value added tax, goods and services tax, provincial sales tax and/or harmonized sales tax on the Services provided under this Agreement.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify">5. Services and Textlake Account Support</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify">We will provide you with support to resolve general issues relating to your Textlake Account and your use of the Services.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">You are solely responsible for providing support to Customers regarding Transaction receipts, product or service delivery, support, returns, refunds, and any other issues related to your products and services and business activities. We are not responsible for providing support for the Services to your Customers unless we agree to do so in a separate agreement with you or one of your Customers.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify">6. Taxes and Other Expenses</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify">Our fees are exclusive of any applicable Taxes, except as expressly stated to the contrary. You have sole responsibility and liability for: (i) determining what, if any, Taxes apply to the sale of your products and services, acceptance of donations, or payments you receive in connection with your use of the Services; and (ii) assessing, collecting, reporting, and remitting Taxes for your business to the appropriate tax and revenue authorities.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify">7. Service Requirements, Limitations and Restrictions</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>a. Compliance with Applicable Laws:</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>You must use the Services in a lawful manner, and must obey all laws, rules, and regulations (“Laws”) applicable to your use of the Services and to Transactions. As applicable, this may include compliance with domestic and international Laws related to the use or provision of financial services, notification and consumer protection, unfair competition, privacy, and false advertising, and any other Laws relevant to Transactions.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>b. Prohibited Businesses and Activities:</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>You may not use the Services to enable any person (including you) to benefit from any activities Textlake has identified as a prohibited business or activity (collectively, “Prohibited Businesses”). Prohibited Businesses include use of the Services in or for the benefit of a country, organization, entity, or person embargoed or blocked by any government, including those on sanctions lists identified by the United States Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">If you are uncertain whether a category of business or activity is prohibited or have questions about how these restrictions apply to you, please contact us.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>c. Other Restricted Activities:</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>You may not use the Services to facilitate illegal Transactions or to permit others to use the Services for personal, family or household purposes. In addition, you may not allow, and may not allow others to: (i) access or attempt to access non-public Textlake systems, programs, data, or services; (ii) copy, reproduce, republish, upload, post, transmit, resell, or distribute in any way, any data, content, or any part of the Services, Documentation, or our website except as expressly permitted by applicable Laws; (iii) act as service bureau or pass-through agent for the Services with no added value to Customers; (iv) transfer any rights granted to you under this Agreement; (v) work around any of the technical limitations of the Services or enable functionality that is disabled or prohibited; (vi) reverse engineer or attempt to reverse engineer the Services except as expressly permitted by Laws; (vii) perform or attempt to perform any actions that would interfere with the normal operation of the Services or affect use of the Services by our other users; or (ix) impose an unreasonable or disproportionately large load on the Service.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify">8. Suspicion of Unauthorized or Illegal Use</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify">We may refuse, condition, or suspend any Transactions that we believe: (i) may violate this Agreement or other agreements you may have with Textlake; (ii) are unauthorized, fraudulent or illegal; or (iii) expose you, Textlake, or others to risks unacceptable to Textlake. If we suspect or know that you are using or have used the Services for unauthorized, fraudulent, or illegal purposes, we may share any information related to such activity with the appropriate financial institution, regulatory authority, or law enforcement agency consistent with our legal obligations. This information may include information about you, your Textlake Account, your Customers, and Transactions made through your use of the Services.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify">9. Disclosures and Notices; Electronic Signature Consent</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>a. Consent to Electronic Disclosures and Notices:</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>By registering for a Textlake Account, you agree that such registration constitutes your electronic signature, and you consent to electronic provision of all disclosures and notices from Textlake (“Notices”), including those required by Law. You also agree that your electronic consent will have the same legal effect as a physical signature.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>b. Methods of Delivery:</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>You agree that Textlake can provide Notices regarding the Services to you through our website or through the Dashboard (as defined below), or by mailing Notices to the email or physical addresses identified in your Textlake Account. Notices may include notifications about your Textlake Account, changes to the Services, or other information we are required to provide to you. You also agree that electronic delivery of a Notice has the same legal effect as if we provided you with a physical copy. We will consider a Notice to have been received by you within 24 hours of the time a Notice is either posted to our website or emailed to you.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>c. SMS and Text Messages:</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>You authorize us to provide Notices to you via text message to allow us to verify your or your Representative’s control over your Textlake Account (such as through two-step verification), and to provide you with other critical information about your Textlake Account. Standard text or data charges may apply to such Notices. Where offered, you may disable text message notifications in the Dashboard by responding to any such message with “STOP”, or by following instructions provided in the message. However, by disabling text messaging, you may be disabling important Security Controls (as defined below) on your Textlake Account and may increase the risk of loss to your business.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>d. Requirements for Delivery:</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>It should come as no surprise to you that you will need a computer or mobile device, Internet connectivity, and an updated browser to access your Dashboard and review the Notices provided to you. If you are having problems viewing or accessing any Notices, please contact us and we can find another means of delivery.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>e. Withdrawing Consent:</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>Due to the nature of the Services, you will not be able to begin using the Services without agreeing to electronic delivery of Notices. However, you may choose to withdraw your consent to receive Notices electronically by terminating your Textlake Account.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify">10. Termination</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>a. Term and Termination:</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>This Agreement is effective upon the date you first access or use the Services and continues until terminated by you or Textlake. You may terminate this Agreement by closing your Textlake Account at any time by contacting us. If you use the Services again or register for another Textlake Account, you are consenting to this Agreement. We may terminate this Agreement or close your Textlake Account at any time for any reason (including, without limitation, for any activity that may create harm or loss to the goodwill of a Payment Method) by providing you Notice. We may suspend your Textlake Account and your ability to access funds in your Textlake Account, or terminate this Agreement, if (i) we determine in our sole discretion that you are ineligible for the Services because of significant fraud or credit risk, or any other risks associated with your Textlake Account; (ii) you use the Services in a prohibited manner or otherwise do not comply with any of the provisions of this Agreement; (iii) any Law, Payment Method Provider or Payment Method Acquirer requires us to do so; or (iv) we are otherwise entitled to do so under this Agreement. A Payment Method Provider or Payment Method Acquirer may terminate your ability to accept its Payment Method, at any time and for any reason, in which case you will no longer be able to accept the Payment Method under this Agreement.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>b. Effects of Termination:</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>Termination does not immediately relieve you of obligations incurred by you under this Agreement. Upon termination, you agree to (i) complete all pending Transactions, (ii) stop accepting new Transactions, and (iii) immediately remove all Textlake and payment network logos from your website (unless permitted under a separate license with the payment network). Your continued or renewed use of the Services after all pending Transactions have been processed serves to renew your consent to the terms of this Agreement.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">In addition, upon termination you understand and agree that (i) all licenses granted to you by Textlake under this Agreement will end; (ii) subject to Section D.5, we reserve the right (but have no obligation) to delete all of your information and account data stored on our servers; (iii) we will not be liable to you for compensation, reimbursement, or damages related to your use of the Services, or any termination or suspension of the Services or deletion of your information or account data; and (iv) you are still liable to us for any Fees or fines, or other financial obligation incurred by you or through your use of the Services prior to termination.</p>
<p><br></p><h2 style="text-align: justify">Section B: Textlake Technology</h2>
<p><br></p><h3 style="text-align: justify">1. API and Dashboard</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify">Textlake has developed and provides access to the API that may be used to access the Services. You may use the API solely as described in the Documentation to use the Services on websites and through the applications identified in your Textlake Account. You may not use the API for any purpose, function, or feature not described in the Documentation or otherwise communicated to you by us. Due to the nature of the Services, we will update the API and Documentation from time to time, and may add or remove functionality. We will provide you Notice in the event of material changes, deprecations, or removal of functionality from the API so that you may continue using the Services with minimal interruption.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify">2. Ownership of Textlake IP</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify">As between you and Textlake, Textlake and its licensors exclusively own all rights, title, and interest in the patents, copyrights (including rights in derivative works), moral rights, rights of publicity, trademarks or service marks, logos and designs, trade secrets, and other intellectual property embodied by, or contained in the API, Services, Dashboard, and Documentation (collectively, “Textlake IP”) or any copies thereof. Textlake IP is protected by copyright, trade secret, patent, and other intellectual property Laws, and all rights in Textlake IP not expressly granted to you in this Agreement are reserved.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">You may choose to or we may invite you to submit comments or ideas about improvements to the Service, our API, our platform, or any other component of our products or services (“Ideas”). If you submit an Idea to us, we will presume that your submission was voluntary, unsolicited by us, and delivered to us without any restrictions on our use of the Idea. You also agree that Textlake has no fiduciary or any other obligation to you in connection with any Idea you submit to us, and that we are free to use your Ideas without any attribution or compensation to you.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify">3. License</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify">You are granted a nonexclusive and nontransferable license to electronically access and use the Textlake IP only in the manner described in this Agreement. Textlake does not sell to you, and you do not have the right to sublicense the Textlake IP. We may make updates to the Textlake IP or new Services available to you automatically as electronically published by Textlake, but we may require action on your part before you may use the Textlake IP or new Services (including activation through the Dashboard, or acceptance of new or additional terms). Textlake may revoke or terminate this licence at any time if you use Textlake IP in a manner prohibited by this Agreement.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">You may not: (i) claim or register ownership of Textlake IP on your behalf or on behalf of others; (ii) sublicense any rights in Textlake IP granted by us; (iii) import or export any Textlake IP to a person or country in violation of any country’s export control Laws; (iv) use Textlake IP in a manner that violates this Agreement or Laws; or (v) attempt to do any of the foregoing.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify">4. Textlake Marks; References to Our Relationship</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify">We may make certain Textlake logos or marks (“Textlake Marks”) available for use by you and other users to allow you to identify Textlake as a service provider. Textlake may limit or revoke your ability to use Textlake Marks at any time. You may never use any Textlake Marks or Textlake IP consisting of trademarks or service marks without our express permission, or in a manner that may lead people to confuse the origin of your products or services with ours.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">During the term of this Agreement, you may publicly identify us as the provider of the Services to you and we may publicly identify you as a Textlake user. If you do not want us to identify you as a user, please contact us. Neither you nor we will imply any untrue sponsorship, endorsement, or affiliation between you and Textlake. Upon termination of your Textlake Account, both you and Textlake will remove any public references to our relationship from our respective websites.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify">5. Content</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify">You may use the Services to upload or publish text, images, and other content (collectively, “Content”) to your Textlake Account and to third-party sites or applications but only if you agree to obtain the appropriate permissions and, if required, licenses to upload or publish any such Content using the Services. You agree to fully reimburse Textlake for all fees, fines, losses, claims, and any other costs we may incur that arise from publishing illegal Content through the Services, or claims that Content you published infringes the intellectual property, privacy, or other proprietary rights of others.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify">6. Additional Services</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify">From time to time we may offer you additional features or services that may be subject to additional or different terms of service. All such additional features and services form part of the Services, and you may not use these additional services unless you agree to the applicable agreement or terms (if any) for those services.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">We may also provide you access to services identified as “beta” or pre-release services. You understand that these services are still in development, may contain bugs or errors, may be feature incomplete, may materially change prior to a full commercial launch, or may never be released commercially. We provide beta services AS IS, and without warranty of any kind, and your use of, or reliance on beta services is at your own risk.</p>
<p><br></p><h2 style="text-align: justify">Section C: Payment Processing Services</h2>
<p><br></p><h3 style="text-align: justify">1. Payment Processing Services Overview</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify">Textlake works with various Textlake affiliates, Payment Method Providers and Payment Method Acquirers to provide you with access to the Payment Methods and Payment Processing Services. Where the Payment Processing Services enable you to submit Charges (as defined below), we may limit or refuse to process Charges for any Prohibited Businesses, or for Charges submitted in violation of this Agreement.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Your use of a Payment Method may be subject to separate terms applicable to the Payment Method. The following terms used in this Agreement relate to your use of Payment Processing Services:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify">
    <li>“Charge” means a credit or debit instruction to capture funds from an account that a Customer maintains with a bank or other financial institution in connection with a Transaction.</li>
    <li>“Dispute” means an instruction initiated by a Customer for the return of funds for an existing Charge (including a chargeback or dispute on a payment card network; and disputes on the Automated Clearinghouse (ACH) network).</li>
    <li>“Fine” means any fines, levies, or other charges imposed by us, a Payment Method Provider or a Payment Method Acquirer, caused by your violation of Laws or this Agreement, or as permitted by the applicable Payment Method Rules.</li>
    <li>“Payment Method Rules” means the guidelines, bylaws, rules, and regulations imposed by the Payment Method Providers and Payment Method Acquirers that operate Payment Methods supported by Textlake.</li>
    <li>“Payment Method” means a type of payment method that Textlake accepts as part of the Payment Processing Services, such as credit card, debit card, and ACH.</li>
    <li>“Payment Method Acquirer” means a financial institution that is authorized by a Payment Method Provider to enable the use of a Payment Method by accepting Charges from Customers on behalf of the Payment Method Provider, and routing these Charges to the Payment Method Provider.</li>

Reversals may result from (i) invalidation of a charge by a Payment Method Provider or a Payment Method Acquirer; (ii) funds settled to you in error or without authorization; and (iii) submission of a Charge in violation of the applicable Payment Method Rules, or where submission of the Charge or your use of Payment Processing Services violates this Agreement.</li>
</ul><h3 style="text-align: justify">2. Registering for Use of Payment Processing Services</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify">When you register for a Textlake Account, you may be asked for financial information, or information we use to identify you, your Representatives, principals, beneficial owners, and other individuals associated with your Textlake Account. Throughout the term of this Agreement, we may share information about your Textlake Account with Payment Method Providers and Payment Method Acquirers in order to verify your eligibility to use the Payment Processing Services, establish any necessary accounts or credit with Payment Method Providers and Payment Method Acquirers, monitor Charges and other activity, and conduct risk management and compliance reviews. We may also share your Data (as that term is defined below) with Payment Method Providers and Payment Method Acquirers for the purpose of facilitating the compliance of Textlake, the Payment Method Providers, and the Payment Method Acquirers with applicable Laws and Payment Method Rules. We will review and may conduct further intermittent reviews of your Textlake Account information to determine that you are eligible to use the Payment Processing Services. Textlake’s use of the information you provide to us under this Agreement is described in more detail in Section D.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify">3. Processing Transactions; Disputes, Refunds, Reversals</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify">You may only submit Charges through the Payment Processing Services that are authorized by your Customers. To enable us to process Transactions for you, you authorize and direct us, our affiliates, the Payment Method Providers and Payment Method Acquirers to receive and settle any payment processing proceeds owed to you through the Payment Processing Services. Except where Textlake and a Customer have otherwise agreed, you maintain the direct relationship with your Customers and are responsible for: (i) acquiring appropriate consent to submit Charges through the Payment Processing Services on their behalf; (ii) providing confirmation or receipts to Customers for each Charge; (iii) verifying Customers’ identities; and (iv) determining a Customer’s eligibility and authority to complete Transactions. However, even authorized Transactions may be subject to a Dispute. Textlake is not responsible for or liable to you for authorized and completed Charges that are later the subject of a Dispute, Refund, or Reversal, are submitted without authorization or in error, or violate any Laws.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">You are immediately responsible to us for all Disputes, Refunds, Reversals, Returns, or Fines regardless of the reason or timing.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Please keep in mind that, as explained in Section D.3, you are liable for all losses you incur when lost or stolen payment credentials or accounts are used to purchase products or services from you. Textlake does not and will not insure you against losses caused by fraud under any circumstances. For example, if someone pretends to be a legitimate buyer but is a fraudster, you will be responsible for any resulting costs, including Disputes, even if you do not recover the fraudulently purchased product.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">A Reversal for a Charge may be issued if the Charge is made without the account owner’s authorization or in connection with a Prohibited Business, violates the applicable Payment Method Rules, or for other applicable reasons. If a Reversal is issued, we will provide you Notice and a description of the cause of the Reversal.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify">4. Responsibilities and Disclosures to Your Customers</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify">It is very important to us that your Customers understand the purpose, amount, and conditions of Charges you submit to us. With that in mind, when using the Payment Processing Services you agree to: (i) accurately communicate, and not misrepresent, the nature of the Transaction, and the amount of the Charge in the appropriate currency; (ii) provide a receipt that accurately describes each Transaction to Customers; (iii) provide Customers a meaningful way to contact you in the event that the product or service is not provided as described; (iv) not use Services to sell products or services in a manner that is unfair or deceptive, exposes Customers to unreasonable risks, or does not disclose material terms of a purchase in advance; and (v) inform Customers that Textlake and its affiliates process Transactions (including payment Transactions) for you. You also agree to maintain and make available to your Customers a fair and neutral return, refund, cancellation, or adjustment policy, and clearly explain the process by which Customers can receive a Refund.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">The Payment Processing Services may include functionality that enables you to receive recurring or subscription payments from your Customers, and to issue invoices to your Customers. If you use the Payment Processing Services to submit recurring or subscription Charges, you agree to comply with applicable Laws and Payment Method Rules, including clearly informing Customers in advance of submitting the initial Charge that they will be charged on an ongoing basis and explaining the method for unsubscribing or cancelling their recurring billing or subscription. If you use the Payment Processing Services to issue invoices to your Customers, you understand and agree that it is your responsibility to ensure that the form and content of the invoices comply with applicable Laws, and are sufficient to achieve any legal or tax effect that you are trying to achieve.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">If you engage in Transactions with Customers who are individuals (i.e. consumers), you specifically agree to provide consumers disclosures required by Law, and to not engage in unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices (“UDAAP”).</p><h3 style="text-align: justify">5. Payment Terms and Financial Services Terms</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify">Your use of the Payment Processing Services is subject to additional terms that apply between you and one or more of Textlake, a Textlake affiliate, and a Payment Method Provider. We may add or remove Payment Method Providers and Payment Method Acquirers at any time. The Payment Terms may also be amended from time to time. Your continuing use of the Payment Processing Services constitutes your consent and agreement to such additions, removals and amendments.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify">6. Specific Payment Methods</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>a. Payment Cards:</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>When accepting payment card payments, you must comply with all applicable Network Rules, including the Network Rules specified by the Visa Rules and Regulations Rules specified by Visa U.S.A., Inc. and Visa International (“Visa”), the Mastercard Rules specified by MasterCard International Incorporated (“Mastercard”), the American Express Merchant Operating Guide specified by American Express, and the Discover Network Rules specified by Discover Financial Services, LLC (“Discover”). Collectively, Visa, Mastercard, American Express and Discover are referred to in this Agreement as the “Networks”.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">The Network Rules state that you may only accept payments using payment cards for bona fide legal commercial transactions between you and your Customers for goods or services that are free of liens, claims, and encumbrances. You may only use payment network trademarks or service marks consistent with the Network Rules, and the Network Rules also limit your ability to discriminate by card type or charge surcharges for acceptance of payment cards.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">The Networks may amend the Network Rules at any time without notice to you, and Textlake reserves the right to change the Payment Processing Services at any time to comply with the Network Rules. We may share with the Networks (and the Payment Method Acquirer) information you provide to us that we use to identify the nature of your products or services, including the assignment of your business activities to a particular payment network merchant category code (MCC).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Customers typically raise payment card network Disputes (also known as “chargebacks”) when a merchant fails to provide the product or service to the Customer, or where the payment card account holder did not authorize the Charge. High Dispute rates (typically those exceeding 1%) may result in your inability to use the Payment Processing Services. Failure to timely and effectively manage Disputes with your Customers may ultimately result in your inability to accept payment cards for your business.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">When you accept payment card Transactions, Network Rules specifically prohibit you from (i) providing cash refunds for a Charge on a credit card, unless required by Laws, (ii) initiating a Refund more than five calendar days after issuing a credit to your Customer, (iii) accepting cash, its equivalent, or any other item of value for a Refund, (iv) acting as a payment facilitator, intermediary or aggregator, or otherwise reselling Payment Processing Services on behalf of others, (v) submitting what you believe or know to be a fraudulent Charge or a Charge that has not been authorized by the cardholder, (vi) submitting a Charge where the Transaction has not been completed or the goods or services have not been shipped or provided (except where the cardholder has paid a partial or full prepayment or the cardholder’s consent is obtained for a recurring transaction), (vii) splitting Transactions into multiple Charges unless certain criteria are met, or (vii) using Payment Processing Services in a manner that is an abuse of the payment card networks or a violation of the Network Rules.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">If you misuse the Payment Processing Services for payment card Transactions or engage in activity the Networks identify as damaging to their brand, or if we are required to do so by the Network Rules, we may submit information about you, Representatives, your beneficial owners and principals, and other individuals associated with your Textlake Account, to the MATCH terminated merchant listing maintained by Mastercard and accessed and updated by Visa and American Express, or to the Consortium Merchant Negative File maintained by Discover. Addition to one of these lists may result in your inability to accept payments from payment cards. You understand and consent to our sharing this information and to the listing itself, and you will fully reimburse us for any losses we incur from third-party claims, and you waive your rights to bring any direct claims against us that result from such reporting. Our reporting of information under this paragraph is separate from any other right that we may exercise under this Agreement, and we may separately terminate this Agreement or suspend your Textlake Account due to the misuse or damaging activity that caused us to make the report.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>b. Automated Clearinghouse (ACH):</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>The ACH network is controlled and managed by the National Automated Clearinghouse Association (NACHA) and its member organizations. Where submitting Charges over the ACH network, you are required to comply with the NACHA Operating Rules. NACHA may amend the NACHA Operating Rules at any time, and we may amend this Agreement or make changes to the Payment Processing Services as necessary to comply with the NACHA Operating Rules.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">You understand and accept your role as the Originator (as defined in the NACHA Operating Rules). You agree to obtain your Customer’s consent to debit or credit their bank account and initiate a Charge over the ACH network. Such consent must be in a form and manner that complies with the NACHA Operating Rules and the Documentation for ACH Transactions. As with other Payment Processing Services, you may not, and may not attempt to send or receive funds to or from a person, entity, or state where such Transactions are prohibited by applicable Law. You also agree to maintain the security and integrity of all information you collect as part of an ACH Transaction.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Any Disputes or unauthorized Charges using the ACH network may result in you becoming unable to accept ACH payments.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify">7. Security Interests, Collection, and Set-Off Rights</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify">You agree to pay all amounts owed to us and to our affiliates on demand. Your failure to pay amounts owed to us or to our affiliates under this Agreement is a breach and you will be liable for any costs we incur during collection in addition to the amount you owe. Collection costs may include, attorneys’ fees and expenses, costs of any arbitration or court proceeding, collection agency fees, any applicable interest, and any other related cost.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify">8. Reconciliation and Error Notification</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify">Except as required by Law, you are solely responsible for reconciling the information generated by your use of Payment Processing Services with your records of Customer Transactions, and for identifying any errors.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">However, you should be aware that your ability to recover funds you have lost due to an error may be very limited or even impossible, particularly if we did not cause the error. For Transaction errors, we will work with you and our Payment Method Providers to correct a Transaction error in accordance with the applicable Payment Method Rules. If you fail to communicate an error to us for our review without undue delay and, in any event, within 60 days after you discovered it, you waive your right to make any claim against us or our Payment Method Providers for any amounts associated with the error.</p>
<p><br></p><h2 style="text-align: justify">Section D: Data Usage, Privacy, and Security</h2>
<p><br></p><h3 style="text-align: justify">1. Data Usage Overview</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify">Protecting, securing, and maintaining the information processed and handled through the Services is one of our top priorities, and it should be yours too. This section describes our respective obligations when handling and storing information connected with the Services. The following terms used in this section relate to data provided to Textlake by you or your Customers, or received or accessed by you through your use of the Services:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify">
    <li>“Payment Account Details” means the Payment Method account details for a Customer, and includes, with respect to credit and debit cards, the cardholder’s account number, card expiration date, and CVV2.</li>
    <li>“Payment Data” means Payment Account Details, information communicated to or by Payment Method Provider or Payment Method Acquirer, financial information specifically regulated by Laws and Payment Method Rules, and any other information used with the Payment Processing Services to complete a Transaction.</li>
    <li>“Personal Data” means information that identifies a specific living person (not a company, legal entity, or machine) and is transmitted to or accessible through the Services.</li>
    <li>“Textlake Data” means details of the API transactions over Textlake infrastructure, information used in fraud detection and analysis, aggregated or anonymized information generated from Data, and any other information created by or originating from Textlake or the Services.</li>
    <li>“User Data” means information that describes your business and its operations, your products or services, and orders placed by Customers. The term “Data” used without a modifier means all Personal Data, User Data, Payment Data, and Textlake Data. Textlake processes, analyzes, and manages Data to: (a) provide Services to you, other Textlake users, and Customers; (b) mitigate fraud, financial loss, or other harm to users, Customers and Textlake; and (c) analyze, develop and improve our products, systems, and tools. Textlake provides Data to third-party service providers, including Payment Method Providers, Payment Method Acquirers, and their respective affiliates, as well as to Textlake’s affiliates, to allow us to provide Services to you and other users. We do not provide Personal Data to unaffiliated parties for marketing their products to you. You understand and consent to Textlake’s use of Data for the purposes and in a manner consistent with this Section D.</li>
</ul><h3 style="text-align: justify">2. Data Protection and Privacy</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>a. Confidentiality:</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>Textlake will only use User Data as permitted by this Agreement, by other agreements between you and us, or as otherwise directed or authorized by you. You will protect all Data you receive through the Services, and you may not disclose or distribute any such Data, and you will only use such Data in conjunction with the Services and as permitted by this Agreement or by other agreements between you and us. Neither party may use any Personal Data to market to Customers unless it has received the express consent from a specific Customer to do so. You may not disclose Payment Data to others except in connection with processing Transactions requested by Customers and consistent with applicable Laws and Payment Method Rules.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>b. Privacy:</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>Protection of Personal Data is very important to us. You agree to the terms of our Privacy Policy, which we may update from time to time.</p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(40,40,40)">You affirm that you are now and will continue to be compliant with all applicable Laws governing the privacy, protection, and your use of Data that you provide to us or access through your use of the Services. You also affirm that you have obtained all necessary rights and consents under applicable Laws to disclose to Textlake – or allow Textlake to collect, use, retain, and disclose – any Personal Data that you provide to us or authorize us to collect, including Data that we may collect directly from Customers using cookies or other similar means. As may be required by Law and in connection with this Agreement, you are solely responsible for disclosing to Customers that Textlake processes Transactions (including payment Transactions) for you and may receive Personal Data from you. Additionally, where required by Law or Payment Method Rules, we may delete or disconnect a Customer’s Personal Data from your Textlake Account when requested to do so by the Customer.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">If we become aware of an unauthorized acquisition, disclosure or loss of Customer Personal Data on our systems, we will notify you consistent with our obligations under applicable Law. We will also notify you and provide you sufficient information regarding the unauthorized acquisition, disclosure or loss to help you mitigate any negative impact on the Customer.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>c. PCI Compliance:</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>If you use Payment Processing Services to accept payment card Transactions, you must comply with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (“PCI-DSS”) and, if applicable to your business, the Payment Application Data Security Standards (PA-DSS) (collectively, the “PCI Standards”). The PCI Standards include requirements to maintain materials or records that contains payment card or Transaction data in a safe and secure manner with access limited to authorized personnel. Textlake provides tools to simplify your compliance with the PCI Standards, but you must ensure that your business is compliant.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">You agree to never store or hold any “Sensitive Authentication Data”, as defined by the PCI Standards (including CVC or CVV2), at any time. You can find information about the PCI Standards on the PCI Council’s website.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify">3. Security and Fraud Controls</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>a. Textlake’s Security:</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>Textlake is responsible for protecting the security of Data in our possession. We will maintain commercially reasonable administrative, technical, and physical procedures to protect User Data and Personal Data stored in our servers from unauthorized access, accidental loss, modification, or breach, and we will comply with applicable Laws and Payment Method Rules when we handle User and Personal Data. However, no security system is impenetrable and we cannot guarantee that unauthorized parties will never be able to defeat our security measures or misuse any Data in our possession. You provide User Data and Personal Data to Textlake with the understanding that any security measures we provide may not be appropriate or adequate for your business, and you agree to implement Security Controls (as defined below) and any additional controls that meet your specific requirements. In our sole discretion, we may take any action, including suspension of your Textlake Account, to maintain the integrity and security of the Services or Data, or to prevent harm to you, us, Customers, or others. You waive any right to make a claim against us for losses you incur that may result from such actions.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>b. Your Security:</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>You are solely responsible for the security of any Data on your website, your servers, in your possession, or that you are otherwise authorized to access or handle. You will comply with applicable Laws and Payment Method Rules when handling or maintaining User Data and Personal Data, and will provide evidence of your compliance to us upon our request. If you do not provide evidence of such compliance to our satisfaction, we may suspend your Textlake Account or terminate this Agreement.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>c. Security Controls:</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>You are responsible for assessing the security requirements of your business, and selecting and implementing security procedures and controls (“Security Controls”) appropriate to mitigate your exposure to security incidents. We may provide Security Controls as part of the Services, or suggest that you implement specific Security Controls. However, your responsibility for securing your business is not diminished by any Security Controls that we provide or suggest, and if you believe that the Security Controls we provide are insufficient, then you must separately implement additional controls that meet your requirements.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>d. Fraud Risk:</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>While we may provide or suggest Security Controls, we cannot guarantee that you or Customers will never become victims of fraud. Any Security Controls we provide or suggest may include processes or applications developed by Textlake, its affiliates, or other companies. You agree to review all the Security Controls we suggest and choose those that are appropriate for your business to protect against unauthorized Transactions and, if appropriate for your business, independently implement other security procedures and controls not provided by us. If you disable or fail to properly use Security Controls, you will increase the likelihood of unauthorized Transactions, Disputes, fraud, losses, and other similar occurrences. Keep in mind that you are solely responsible for losses you incur from the use of lost or stolen payment credentials or accounts by fraudsters who engage in fraudulent Transactions with you, and your failure to implement Security Controls will only increase the risk of fraud. We may assist you with recovering lost funds, but you are solely responsible for losses due to lost or stolen credentials or accounts, compromise of your username or password, changes to your Payout Account, and any other unauthorized use or modification of your Textlake Account. Textlake is not liable or responsible to you and you waive any right to bring a claim against us for any losses that result from the use of lost or stolen credentials or unauthorized use or modification of your Textlake Account. Further, you will fully reimburse us for any losses we incur that result from the use of lost or stolen credentials or accounts.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">We may also provide you with Data regarding the possibility or likelihood that a Transaction may be fraudulent. We may incorporate any subsequent action or inaction by you into our fraud model, for the purpose of identifying future potential fraud. You understand that we provide this Data to you for your consideration, but that you are ultimately responsible for any actions you choose to take or not take in relation to such Data.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify">4. Your Use of Data with Textlake</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify">When using Textlake, you will have the ability to connect your Textlake Account with a Platform or App. Connected Platforms and Apps may take certain actions on your behalf and access Data available through your Textlake Account, including some User Data. You authorize Textlake to share Data with any Platform or App that you connect with your Textlake Account through the Dashboard or the API. You also understand that at any point you may disallow any such sharing by removing the Platform or App from your Textlake Account. You waive your right to bring any claims against Textlake for losses you incur that arise from any actions or use of Data by any Platform or App connected to your Textlake Account, and you will fully reimburse us for any losses we incur that result from your actions or use of such Data by any Platform or App.</p>
<p><br></p><h2 style="text-align: justify">Section E: Additional Legal Terms</h2>
<p><br></p><h3 style="text-align: justify">1. Right to Amend</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify">We have the right to change or add to the terms of this Agreement at any time, solely with prospective effect, and to change, delete, discontinue, or impose conditions on use of the Services by posting such changes on our website or any other website we maintain or own. We will provide you with Notice of any changes through the Dashboard, via email, or through other reasonable means. If you are an existing Textlake user, the changes will come into effect 10 days after we post the changes to our website, and your use of the Services, API, or Data more than 10 days after we publish any such changes on our website, constitutes your acceptance of the terms of the modified Agreement. You can access a copy of the current terms of this Agreement on our website at any time.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify">2. Assignment</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify">You may not assign this Agreement, any rights or licenses granted in this Agreement, or operation of your Textlake Account to others without our prior written consent. If you wish to make such an assignment, please contact us. If we consent to the assignment, the assignee must agree to assume all of your rights and obligations owed by you related to the assignment, and must agree to comply with the terms of this Agreement. Textlake may assign this Agreement without your consent or any other restriction. If we make an assignment, we will provide reasonable Notice to you.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify">3. Right to Audit</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify">If we believe that a security breach, leak, loss, or compromise of Data has occurred on your systems, website, or app affecting your compliance with this Agreement, we may require you to permit a third-party auditor approved by us to conduct a security audit of your systems and facilities, and you must fully cooperate with any requests for information or assistance that the auditor makes to you as part of the security audit. The auditor will issue a report to us which we may share with our Payment Method Providers and Payment Methods Acquirers.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify">4. No Agency; Third-Party Services</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify">Except as expressly stated in this Agreement, nothing in this Agreement serves to establish a partnership, joint venture, or other agency relationship between you and us, or with any Payment Method Provider. Each party to this Agreement, and each Payment Method Provider, is an independent contractor. Unless a Payment Method Provider expressly agrees, neither you nor we have the ability to bind a Payment Method Provider to any contract or obligation, and neither party will represent that you or we have such an ability.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">We may reference or provide access to third-party services, products, and promotions that utilize, integrate, or provide ancillary services to the Services (“Third-Party Services”). These Third-Party Services are provided for your convenience only and do not constitute our approval, endorsement, or recommendation of any such Third-Party Services for you. You access and use any Third-Party Service based on your own evaluation and at your own risk. You understand that your use of any Third-Party Service is not governed by this Agreement. If you decide to use a Third-Party Service, you will be responsible for reviewing, understanding and accepting the terms and conditions associated with its use. We expressly disclaim all responsibility and liability for your use of any Third-Party Service. Please also remember that when you use a Third-Party Service, our Privacy Policy is no longer in effect. Your use of a Third-Party Service, including those that have a link on our website, is subject to that Third-Party Service’s own terms of use and privacy policies.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify">5. Force Majeure</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify">Neither party will be liable for any delays in processing or other nonperformance caused by telecommunications, utility, failures, or equipment failures; labor strife, riots, war, or terrorist attacks; nonperformance of our vendors or suppliers, fires or acts of nature; or any other event over which the respective party has no reasonable control. However, nothing in this section will affect or excuse your liabilities or your obligation to pay Fees, Fines, Disputes, Refunds, Reversals, or Returns under this Agreement.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify">6. Your Liability For Third-Party Claims Against Us</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify">Without limiting, and in addition to, any other obligation that you may owe under this Agreement, you are at all times responsible for the acts and omissions of your employees, contractors and agents, to the extent such persons are acting within the scope of their relationship with you.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">You agree to defend Textlake, our affiliates, and their respective employees, agents, and service providers (each a “Textlake Entity”) against any claim, suit, demand, loss, liability, damage, action, or proceeding (each, a “Claim”) brought by a third party against a Textlake Entity, and you agree to fully reimburse the Textlake Entities for any Claims that results from: (i) your breach of any provision of this Agreement; (ii) any Fees, Fines, Disputes, Refunds, Reversals, Returns, or any other liability we incur that results from your use of the Payment Processing Services; (iii) negligent or willful misconduct of your employees, contractors, or agents; or (iv) contractual or other relationships between you and Customers. Important Note for Sole Proprietors: If you are using Services as a sole proprietor, please keep in mind that the Law and the terms of this Agreement consider you and your business to be legally one and the same. You are personally responsible and liable for your use of the Services, payment of Fees, Refunds, Reversals, Fines, losses based on Disputes or fraud, or for any other amounts you owe under this Agreement for your failure to use Security Controls, and for all other obligations to us and to your Customers. You risk personal financial loss if you fail to pay any amounts owed.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify">7. Representations and Warranties</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify">By accepting the terms of this Agreement, you represent and warrant that: (a) you are eligible to register and use the Services and have the authority to execute and perform the obligations required by this Agreement; (b) any information you provide us about your business, products, or services is accurate and complete; (c) any Charges represent a Transaction for permitted products, services, or donations, and any related information accurately describes the Transaction; (d) you will fulfill all of your obligations to Customers and will resolve all Disputes with them; (e) you will comply with all Laws applicable to your business and use of the Services; (f) your employees, contractors and agents will at all times act consistently with the terms of this Agreement; (g) you will not use Payment Processing Services for personal, family or household purposes, for peer-to-peer money transmission, or (except in the normal course of business) intercompany Transactions; and (h) you will not use the Services, directly or indirectly, for any fraudulent or illegal undertaking, or in any manner that interferes with the normal operation of the Services.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify">8.

NO DATA, DOCUMENTATION OR ANY OTHER INFORMATION PROVIDED BY TEXTLAKE OR OBTAINED BY YOU FROM OR THROUGH THE SERVICES – WHETHER FROM TEXTLAKE OR ANOTHER TEXTLAKE ENTITY, AND WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN – CREATES OR IMPLIES ANY WARRANTY FROM A TEXTLAKE ENTITY TO YOU.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">YOU AFFIRM THAT NO TEXTLAKE ENTITY CONTROLS THE PRODUCTS OR SERVICES THAT YOU OFFER OR SELL OR THAT YOUR CUSTOMERS PURCHASE USING THE PAYMENT PROCESSING SERVICES. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT WE CANNOT GUARANTEE AND WE DISCLAIM ANY KNOWLEDGE THAT YOUR CUSTOMERS POSSESS THE AUTHORITY TO MAKE, OR WILL COMPLETE, ANY TRANSACTION.</p>

YOU UNDERSTAND THAT THE TEXTLAKE ENTITIES MAKE NO GUARANTEES TO YOU REGARDING TRANSACTION PROCESSING TIMES OR PAYOUT SCHEDULES.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">NOTHING IN THIS AGREEMENT OPERATES TO EXCLUDE, RESTRICT OR MODIFY THE APPLICATION OF ANY IMPLIED CONDITION, WARRANTY OR GUARANTEE, OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHT OR REMEDY, OR THE IMPOSITION OF ANY LIABILITY UNDER LAW WHERE TO DO SO WOULD: (A) CONTRAVENE THAT LAW; OR (B) CAUSE ANY TERM OF THIS AGREEMENT TO BE VOID.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify">9. Limitation of Liability</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify">Under no circumstances will any Textlake Entity be responsible or liable to you for any indirect, punitive, incidental, special, consequential, or exemplary damages resulting from your use or inability to use the Services or for the unavailability of the Services, for lost profits, personal injury, or property damage, or for any other damages arising out of, in connection with, or relating to this Agreement or your use of the Services, even if such damages are foreseeable, and whether or not you or the Textlake Entities have been advised of the possibility of such damages. The Textlake Entities are not liable, and deny responsibility for, any damages, harm, or losses to you arising from or relating to hacking, tampering, or other unauthorized access or use of the Services, your Textlake Account, or Data, or your failure to use or implement anti-fraud measures, Security Controls, or any other data security measure.

<p style="text-align: justify">These limitations on our liability to you will apply regardless of the legal theory on which your claim is based, including contract, tort (including negligence), strict liability, or any other theory or basis.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">We provide the Services from facilities in the United States. We do not claim, and we cannot guarantee that Services we provide from the United States are or will be appropriate or available for any other location or jurisdiction, comply with the Laws of any other location or jurisdiction, or comply with Laws governing export, import, or foreign use.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify">10. Responding to Legal Process</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify">Textlake may respond to and comply with any writ of attachment, lien, levy, subpoena, warrant, or other legal order (“Legal Process”) that we believe to be valid. We or any Payment Method Provider (including, where applicable, the Payment Method Acquirer for the Payment Method) may deliver or hold any funds or, subject to the terms of our Privacy Policy, any Data as required under such Legal Process, even if you are receiving funds or Data on behalf of other parties. Where permitted by Law, we will make reasonable efforts to provide you Notice of such Legal Process by sending a copy to the email address we have on file for you. Textlake is not responsible for any losses, whether direct or indirect, that you may incur as a result of our response or compliance with a Legal Process.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify">11. Dispute Resolution; Agreement to Arbitrate</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>a. Binding Arbitration:</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>In the event that there is a dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to statutory or common law claims, the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity of any provision of this Agreement, and the determination of the scope or applicability of your agreement to arbitrate any dispute, claim or controversy originating from this Agreement, but specifically excluding any dispute principally related to either party’s intellectual property (which such dispute will be resolved in litigation before the United States District Court), will be determined by arbitration in State of Texas before a single arbitrator.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>b. Service of Process:</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>Each party hereby irrevocably and unconditionally consents to service of process through personal service at their corporate headquarters, registered address, or primary address (for individuals or sole proprietors). Nothing in this Agreement will affect the right of any party to serve process in any other manner permitted by Law.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>c. Class Waiver:</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>To the fullest extent permitted by Law, each of the parties agrees that any dispute arising out of or in connection with this Agreement, whether in arbitration or in court, will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative action. If for any reason a claim or dispute proceeds in court rather than through arbitration, each party knowingly and irrevocably waives any right to trial by jury in any action, proceeding or counterclaim arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated between the parties.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>d. Provision of an Award:</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>Subject to the limitations of liability identified in this Agreement, the appointed arbitrators may award monetary damages and any other remedies allowed by the laws of the State of Texas. In making a determination, the arbitrator will not have the authority to modify any term or provision of this Agreement. The arbitrator will deliver a reasoned written decision with respect to the dispute (the “Award”) to each party, who will promptly act in accordance with the Award. The decision of the arbitrator will be final and binding on the parties, and will not be subject to appeal or review.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>e. Fees:</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>Each party will advance one-half of the fees and expenses of the arbitrators, the costs of the attendance of the arbitration reporter at the arbitration hearing, and the costs of the arbitration facility. In any arbitration arising out of or related to this Agreement, the arbitrators will award to the prevailing party, if any, the costs and attorneys’ fees reasonably incurred by the prevailing party in connection with those aspects of its claims or defenses on which it prevails, and any opposing awards of costs and legal fees awards will be offset.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>f. Confidentiality:</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>The parties will maintain the confidential nature of the arbitration proceeding, the hearing and the Award, except (i) as may be necessary to prepare for or conduct the arbitration hearing on the merits, (ii) in connection with a court application as contemplated above for a preliminary remedy, or confirmation of an Award or its enforcement, (iii) our disclosure of the Award in confidential settlement negotiations, or (iv) as otherwise required by applicable Laws. The parties, witnesses, and arbitrator will treat as confidential and will not disclose to any third person (other than witnesses or experts) any documentary or other evidence produced in any arbitration hereunder, except as required by Law or except if such evidence was obtained from the public domain or was otherwise obtained independently from the arbitration.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>g. Conflict of Rules:</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>In the case of a conflict between the provisions of this Section E.11.g and the rules governing arbitration identified in Section E.11.a, the provisions of this Section E.11.g will prevail. If any provision of this Agreement to arbitrate is held invalid or unenforceable, it will be so held to the minimum extent required by Law and all the other provisions will remain valid and enforceable.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify">12. Entire Agreement</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify">This Agreement and all policies and procedures that are incorporated by reference constitute the entire agreement between you and Textlake for provision and use of the Services. Except where expressly stated otherwise in a writing executed between you and Textlake, this Agreement will prevail over any conflicting policy or agreement for the provision or use of the Services. This Agreement sets forth your exclusive remedies with respect to the Services. If any provision or portion of this Agreement is held to be invalid or unenforceable under Law, then it will be reformed and interpreted to accomplish the objectives of such provision to the greatest extent possible, and all remaining provisions will continue in full force and effect.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify">13. Cumulative Rights, Construction, Waiver</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify">The rights and remedies of the parties under this Agreement are cumulative, and either party may enforce any of its rights or remedies under this Agreement, along with all other rights and remedies available to it at Law, in equity or under the Payment Method Rules. No provision of this Agreement will be construed against any party on the basis of that party being the drafter. Unless expressly stated otherwise, the use of the term “including” or “such as” is not to be interpreted as limiting the generality of the text preceding the term. The failure of either party to enforce any provision of this Agreement will not constitute a waiver of that party’s rights to subsequently enforce the provision.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify">14.
