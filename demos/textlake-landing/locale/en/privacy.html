</ul><h3>1. Overview</h3>
<p>Textlake obtains Personal Data about you from various sources to provide our Services and to manage our Sites. “You” may be a visitor to one of our websites, a user of one or more of our Services (“User” or “Textlake User”), or a customer of a User (“Customer”). If you are a Customer, Textlake will generally not collect your Personal Data directly from you. Your agreement with the relevant Textlake User should explain how the&nbsp;Textlake User shares your Personal Data with Textlake, and if you have questions about this sharing, then you should direct those questions to the&nbsp;Textlake User.</p>
<p><strong>a. Site visitors.</strong></p>
<p>If you visit or use our Sites, we may collect Personal Data. For example, we collect Personal Data that you submit to us via online forms and surveys, and when you contact us by email.</p>
<p><strong>b. Payment processing services (Textlake as a data processor).</strong></p>
<p>As a processor of payment transactions and provider of related services, we may collect, use and disclose Personal Data about Customers when we act as a&nbsp;Textlake User’s service provider.&nbsp;Textlake Users are responsible for making sure that the Customer’s privacy rights are respected, including ensuring appropriate disclosures about third party data collection and use. To the extent that we are acting as a&nbsp;Textlake User’s data processor, we will process Personal Data in accordance with the terms of our agreement with the&nbsp;Textlake User and the&nbsp;Textlake User’s lawful instructions. If you are a Customer and would like to obtain more information about how a&nbsp;Textlake User uses third party services like&nbsp;Textlake to process your Personal Data in the context of payment transactions, please contact the&nbsp;Textlake User directly or visit the&nbsp;Textlake User’s privacy policy.</p>
<p><strong>c. Fraud prevention activities and activities for offering a compliant and secure platform.</strong></p>
<p>The collection and use of Personal Data is critical in helping us to ensure that our platform and services are safe, secure and compliant. In the context of fraud monitoring, prevention and detection services, we may monitor insights and patterns of payment transactions and other online signals to reduce the risk of fraud, money laundering and other harmful activity for ourselves, our Users and their Customers. The&nbsp;Textlake entities responsible for the collection and use of Personal Data for fraud monitoring, detection and prevention activities are<span>&nbsp;</span>indicated below.</p><h3>2. Personal Data We Collect</h3>
<p><strong>a. Personal Data that we collect about you.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Personal Data</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>is any information that relates to an identified or identifiable individual. The Personal Data that you provide directly to us through our Sites will be apparent from the context in which you provide the data. In particular:</p>
<ul>
    <li>When you register for a Textlake account we collect your full name, email address, and account log-in credentials.</li>
    <li>When you fill-in our online form to contact our sales team, we collect your full name, work email, country, and anything else you tell us about your project, needs and timeline.</li>
</ul>
<p>When you respond to Textlake emails or surveys we collect your email address, name and any other information you choose to include in the body of your email or responses. If you contact us by phone, we will collect the phone number you use to call Textlake. If you contact us by phone as a Textlake User, we may collect additional information in order to verify your identity.</p>
<p>If you are a Textlake User, you will provide your contact details, such as name, postal address, telephone number, and email address. As part of your business relationship with us, we may also receive financial and personal information about you, such as your date of birth and government identifiers associated with you and your organization (such as your social security number, tax number, or Employer Identification Number).</p>
<p>If you are a Customer, when you make payments or conduct transactions through a Textlake User’s website or application, we will receive your transaction information. Depending on how the Textlake User implements our Services, we may receive this information directly from you, or from the Textlake User or third parties. The information that we collect will include payment method information (such as credit or debit card number, or bank account information), purchase amount, date of purchase, and payment method. Different payment methods may require the collection of different categories of information. The Textlake User will determine the payment methods that it enables you to use, and the payment method information that we collect will depend upon the payment method that you choose to use from the list of available payment methods that are offered to you by the Textlake User.</p>
<p>When we conduct fraud monitoring, prevention and detection activities, we may also receive Personal Data about you from our business partners, financial service providers, identity verification services, and publicly available sources (e.g., name, address, phone number, country), as necessary to confirm your identity and prevent fraud. Our fraud monitoring, detection and prevention services may use technology that helps us assess the risk associated with an attempted transaction that is enabled on the Textlake User’s website or the application that collects information.</p>
<p>You may also choose to submit information to us via other methods, including: (i) in response to marketing or other communications, (ii) through social media or online forums, (iii) through participation in an offer, program or promotion, (iv) in connection with an actual or potential business relationship with us, or (v) by giving us your business card or contact details at trade shows or other events.</p>
<p><strong>b. Information that we collect automatically on our Sites.</strong></p>
<p>Our Sites use cookies and other technologies to function effectively. These technologies record information about your use of our Sites, including:</p>

    <li><strong>Usage data</strong>, such as time spent on the Sites, pages visited, links clicked, language preferences, and the pages that led or referred you to our Sites.</li>
</ul>
<p>We also may collect information about your online activities on websites and connected devices over time and across third-party websites, devices, apps and other online features and services.

<p><strong>a. Our products and services.</strong></p>
<p>We rely upon a number of legal grounds to ensure that our use of your Personal Data is compliant with applicable law. We use Personal Data to facilitate the business relationships we have with our Users, to comply with our financial regulatory and other legal obligations, and to pursue our legitimate business interests. We also use Personal Data to complete payment transactions and to provide payment-related services to our Users.</p>
<p><strong>Contractual and pre-contractual business relationships.</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>We use Personal Data for the purpose of entering into business relationships with prospective Textlake Users, and to perform the contractual obligations under the contacts that we have with Textlake Users. Activities that we conduct in this context include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Creation and management of Textlake accounts and&nbsp;Textlake account credentials, including the evaluation of applications to commence or expand the use of our Services;</li>
    <li>Accounting, auditing, and billing activities; and</li>
    <li>Processing of payments, communications regarding such payments, and related customer service.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Legal and regulatory compliance.</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>We use Personal Data to verify the identity of our Users in order to comply with fraud monitoring, prevention and detection obligations, laws associated with the identification and reporting of illegal and illicit activity, such as AML (Anti-Money Laundering) and KYC (Know-Your-Customer) obligations, and financial reporting obligations. For example, we may be required to record and verify a User’s identity for the purpose of compliance with legislation intended to prevent money laundering and financial crimes. These obligations are imposed on us by the operation of law, industry standards, and by our financial partners, and may require us to report our compliance to third parties, and to submit to third party verification audits.</p>
<p><strong>Legitimate business interests.</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>We rely on our legitimate business interests to process Personal Data about you. The following list sets out the business purposes that we have identified as legitimate. In determining the content of this list, we balanced our interests against the legitimate interests and rights of the individuals whose Personal Data we process. We:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Monitor, prevent and detect fraud and unauthorized payment transactions;</li>
    <li>Mitigate financial loss, claims, liabilities or other harm to Users and Textlake;</li>
    <li>Respond to inquiries, send service notices and provide customer support;</li>
    <li>Promote, analyze, modify and improve our products, systems, and tools, and develop new products and services;</li>
    <li>Manage, operate and improve the performance of our Sites and Services by understanding their effectiveness and optimizing our digital assets;</li>
    <li>Analyze and advertise our products and services;</li>
    <li>Conduct aggregate analysis and develop business intelligence that enable us to operate, protect, make informed decisions, and report on the performance of, our business;</li>
    <li>Share Personal Data with third party service providers that provide services on our behalf and business partners which help us operate and improve our business;</li>
    <li>Ensure network and information security throughout&nbsp;Textlake and our Services; and</li>
    <li>Transmit Personal Data within our affiliates for internal administrative purposes.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Payment transactions and related services (Textlake as a data processor).</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>As a processor of payment transactions, we use Personal Data of our User’s Customers to process online payment transactions on behalf of our Users. All such use is pursuant to the terms of our business relationships with our Users. In addition, we may offer payment-related services to Users who have requested such services, and our delivery of such related services to our Users may involve the use of Personal Data.&nbsp; The entity responsible for the collection and use of Customer’s Personal Data in the context of payment transactions and payment-related services is the User.</p>
<p>If we need to use your Personal Data in other ways, we will provide specific notice at the time of collection and obtain your consent where required by applicable law.</p>
<p><strong>b. Marketing and events-related communications.</strong></p>
<p>We may send you email marketing communications about&nbsp;Textlake products and services, invite you to participate in our events or surveys, or otherwise communicate with you for marketing purposes, provided that we do so in accordance with the consent requirements that are imposed by applicable law. When we collect your business contact details through our participation at trade shows or other events, we may use the information to follow-up with you regarding an event, send you information that you have requested on our products and services and, with your permission, include you on our marketing information campaigns.</p>
<p><strong>c. Interest-based advertising.</strong></p>
<p>When you visit our Sites or online services, both we and certain third parties collect information about your online activities over time and across different sites to provide you with advertising about products and services tailored to your individual interests (this type of advertising is called “interest-based advertising”). These third parties may place or recognize a unique cookie or other technology on your browser (including the use of pixel tags). Where required by applicable law, we will obtain your consent prior to processing of your information for the purpose of interest-based advertising.</p>
<p>You may see our ads on other websites or mobile apps because we participate in advertising networks. Ad networks allow us to target our messaging to users based on a range of factors, including demographic data, users’ inferred interests and browsing context (for example, the time and date of your visit to our Sites, the pages that you viewed, and the links that you clicked on). This technology also helps us track the effectiveness of our marketing efforts and understand if you have seen one of our advertisements.</p>
<p>We work with Google AdWords, Doubleclick, AdRoll and other advertising networks. To learn how to opt out of behavioral advertising delivered by Network Advertising Initiative member companies, please visit the<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp" style="text-decoration: underline">Network Advertising Initative</a><span>&nbsp;</span>and<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.aboutads.info/" style="text-decoration: underline">Digital Advertising Alliance</a>. You may download the<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="http://youradchoices.com/appchoices" style="text-decoration: underline">AppChoices app</a><span>&nbsp;</span>to opt out in mobile apps. If you opt out from interest-based advertising, you may see advertising that is not relevant to you. At present, there is no industry standard for recognizing Do Not Track browser signals, so we do not respond to them.</p><h3>4. How We Disclose Personal Data.</h3>

If you feel that you have not received a satisfactory response from us, you may consult with the data protection authority in your country.</p>
<p>For your protection, we may need to verify your identity before responding to your request, such as verifying that the email address from which you send the request matches your email address that we have on file.

Security and Retention.</h3>
<p>We make reasonable efforts to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk associated with the processing of Personal Data. We maintain organizational, technical and administrative measures designed to protect Personal Data within our organization against unauthorized access, destruction, loss, alteration or misuse. Your Personal Data is only accessible to a limited number of personnel who need access to the information to perform their duties. Unfortunately, no data transmission or storage system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. If you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure (for example, if you feel that the security of your account has been compromised), please<span>&nbsp;</span>contact us<span>&nbsp;</span>immediately.</p>
<p>If you are a&nbsp;Textlake User, we retain your Personal Data as long as we are providing the Services to you. We retain Personal Data after we cease providing Services to you, even if you close your&nbsp;Textlake account, to the extent necessary to comply with our legal and regulatory obligations, and for the purpose of fraud monitoring, detection and prevention. We also retain Personal Data to comply with our tax, accounting, and financial reporting obligations, where we are required to retain the data by our contractual commitments to our financial partners, and where data retention is mandated by the payment methods that we support. Where we retain data, we do so in accordance with any limitation periods and records retention obligations that are imposed by applicable law.</p><h3>7. International Data Transfers.</h3>
<p>We are a global business. Personal Data may be stored and processed in any country where we have operations or where we engage service providers. We may transfer Personal Data that we maintain about you to recipients in countries other than the country in which the Personal Data was originally collected, including to the United States.

However, we will take measures to ensure that any such transfers comply with applicable data protection laws and that your Personal Data remains protected to the standards described in this Privacy Policy. In certain circumstances, courts, law enforcement agencies, regulatory agencies or security authorities in those other countries may be entitled to access your Personal Data.</p>
